HRC Shop in Rails
=======================

## Synopsis

This is a project I am working on since finishing at Makers Academy to continue getting used to Rails. The aim is to try and create a type of market place similar to www.stillwhite.co.uk for people to sell (or trade) Hard Rock Cafe Pins. I also want to use this to as a platform to practice my front-end work and look at using more advanced CSS.

## Technologies Used

Ruby on Rails
Postgresql
HTML/CSS
Javascript/jQuery on the front-end (planned)
