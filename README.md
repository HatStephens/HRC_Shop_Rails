HRC Shop in Rails
=======================

## Synopsis

Rather than re-create Instagram, I have opted to create a shop (so sticking with the idea of users uploading images) whilst also providing me a platform to test Stripe. This will be my third Rails project.

## Technologies Used

Ruby on Rails
Postgresql
HTML/CSS
Javascript/jQuery on the front-end (planned)

## Job List

- [ ] Set up the Rails App
- [ ] Add Users and logins (using Devise)
- [ ] Set up Product Model which takes a cost, details and photo
- [ ] Allow Users to upload photos of their product for sale
